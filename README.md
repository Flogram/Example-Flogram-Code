# Flogram Language

Flogram is the first programming language designed to be written by AI. We have built Flogram from the ground up to change the way AI and code work together. Together, Flogram and AI revolutionize the developer's coding experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with Flogram, visit the official [Flogram website](https://flogram.dev/) for instructions, tutorials and documentation.

## Examples

This repository contains various examples that showcase the capabilities and syntax of Flogram:

- Arithmetic Operations
- Builtin Functions
- Casting
- Data Types
- Enums
- Import-Export
- Logical Operations
- Objects

... and more.

Each example is provided in a `.flo` file format that can be easily executed in a Flogram environment.
